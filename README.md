# Rusty-forest

A terminal application inspired by [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc). The difference is that this doesn't monitor what you do, so it works just as a "dopamine button". If you procrastinate while your tree is growing, nothing is going to happen, you're just lying to yourself.

## Installation

Run

> cargo install rusty-forest

## Usage

For more help, you can use

> rusty-forest --help

For more detailed information, check the [documentation](https://github.com/tincaMatei/rusty-forest/blob/main/DOCS.md).
